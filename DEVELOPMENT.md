# Setting up for Development

local-aprs uses Node.js for the server-side and Angular for the client side.
In order to do development, you'll need to setup the following:

* Typescript  
* Node.js  
* An editor of your choice, like 'Atom', 'Visual Studio Code', or 'vi'.  

Additionally, you need to have a radio and KISS TNC setup, and configured
to make itself available using KISS-over-TCP/IP.  'share-tnc' is a good
choice for doing this.
